# passwoodGenerator_module3

## Description
This project contains the third homework which is to create a password generator. In this homework I, using code provided, created a password generator that prompts the user for password requirements and generates a random password based on those criteria. The password is then injected into the html and displayed so that the password can be copied by the user.
